# RTL to GDS VLSI Tool Repository

Welcome to the **RTL to GDS VLSI Tool Repository**, a comprehensive resource for understanding, installing, and working with various tools used in the **VLSI design flow** from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDS (Graphic Data System). This repository is primarily intended for beginners and students looking to explore, learn, and understand the open-source VLSI tools.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, with each folder dedicated to a specific tool. Each tool's folder contains a detailed `README.md` file with the following information:

- **Tool Description**: Overview of the tool, its purpose, and key features.
- **Installation Steps**: Step-by-step guide to set up the tool on your system.
- **Usage Instructions**: How to use the tool effectively in your VLSI design projects.
- **Additional Resources**: References, documentation links, and tutorials for further learning.

### Current Tools 
(Work In Progress )
