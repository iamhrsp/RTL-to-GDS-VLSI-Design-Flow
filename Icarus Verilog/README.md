# Verilog Simulation and Code Coverage Tools

This repository provides detailed instructions for installing and working with **ICARUS Verilog** for simulation and **COVERED** for code coverage analysis.

---

## Objectives

- To demonstrate the **installation of simulation and code coverage tools**.
- To understand how to use these tools with example Verilog code.

---

## Tools Covered

1. **ICARUS Verilog**  
   A widely used open-source tool for **Verilog simulation**, allowing designers to simulate and verify their RTL designs.  
   [Visit ICARUS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog)

2. **GTKWave**  
   An analysis tool for debugging Verilog or VHDL simulation models using **waveform visualization**.  
   Installed alongside ICARUS for viewing simulation results.

3. **COVERED**  
   An open-source **Verilog code coverage analyzer** to estimate how much of the RTL design is tested by a testbench.  
   [Visit COVERED GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chiphackers/covered)
